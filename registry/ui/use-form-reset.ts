 * The hook behind the form reset of Switch, Combobox, DatePicker and DateRangePicker: fields that keep their value in
 * React state and submit it through a hidden input, which a form reset does not touch. It lives in its own file
 * without "use client", so a project's own field can call it too.
 */

/**
 * Calls `onReset` when the form that owns `field` has been reset, as a native field would be: by a reset button,
 * form.reset(), or the reset React runs after a form action. `field` is any element with a form owner (a button, an
 * input, a hidden input), found as an ancestor or through the form attribute.
 * A reset can be cancelled (`<form onReset={(event) => event.preventDefault()}>`), and native fields then keep their
 * values. Nothing says so while the event is still travelling: React's own handlers run at the root, after the
 * form's listeners. So the hook waits until the dispatch is over and calls `onReset` only if nobody cancelled it.
 * A reset from a script has finished by the next microtask; one from a click on a reset button has not, since
 * microtasks run between its listeners, and is checked in a task of its own.
